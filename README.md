<h1>Handwritten Digit Classifier (MNIST)</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) in PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing and augmentation to model training, validation, and testing.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Skills Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>Pytorch</b>
- <b>matplotlib</b>
- <b>Deep Learning: Data Preprocessing, Model Evaluation</b>



## Key Features

- **CNN Architecture:** Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activations and adaptive pooling for flexible input sizes.  
- **Data Augmentation:** Random rotations and translations to improve model generalization.  
- **Training & Validation:** Implements training loops with cross-entropy loss, and model checkpointing.  
- **Inference:** Preprocesses external images (including noisy images) for predictions.  
- **Simulation:** Includes a function to randomly fetch and classify MNIST test images.
